## Overview

Generative AI utilized to help community members track water usage within their households to help them make cost saving adjustments in their daily routine.

## Importance of Water Conservation

On average, Americans use more than 300 billion gallons of water per day altogether. Daily water consumption is a small part of every individual's daily lives, but is incredibly important in the bigger picture of the Earth's conservation. To prevent droughts, water scarcity, and other concerns, water and other equally important resources must be properly managed and regulated in order to help conserve the natural environment of our planet. With the help of artificial intelligence, any user will be able to properly monitor and manage their water consumption to not only help them save money, but give them a chance to contribute to the conservation of our planet's water supply and environmental habitats.

AI Water Conservation will provide solutions in the form of:
- Daily water consumption tracking through different water fixtures
- Provide personalized and useful suggestions/recommendations on where water can be saved
- Help users calculate how much money they can save from different water conservation methods
- Educate users with different comparable statistics on water consumption within their region
